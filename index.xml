      <description>Focus Light is a Machine Learning based IoT system that helps people focusing on their work. The system runs at the background of the computer, collects user activities, and identifies the user&amp;rsquo;s current working status. A light bulb is connected to the system to indicate the user&amp;rsquo;s status. When the system detects that the user is currently focusing, the light bulb turns red which informs the colleagues that this person is currently busy which potentially reduces unnecessary interruptions in the workplace.</description>
